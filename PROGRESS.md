# Calculator Boss — Build Progress & Priority Queue

Read this together with `DESIGN_AND_SEO_GUIDE.md` at the start of every session.
The guide covers **how** to build/audit a page (design system, SEO checklist,
3-card pattern, protected style block rule). This file tracks **what's been
done and what's next** so a new session doesn't need the whole history
re-explained.

## GSC-based priority queue (established mid-July 2026)

| # | Calculator | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Horsepower Calculator | Upgrade | ✅ DONE — 4 tabs: Torque & RPM (with Solve For + power-to-weight), Force/Distance/Time, Power Unit Converter, Wheel ↔ Crank HP (drivetrain loss) |
| 2 | Engine Horsepower Calculator | Upgrade | ✅ DONE — 4 tabs: Elapsed Time (ET), Trap Speed, Predict My Run (reverse), 1/8-Mile Converter |
| 3 | Time Zone Calculator | Upgrade (thin, ~434 lines) | ✅ DONE — rebuilt to 3-card pattern: city-to-city converter (33 cities, DST-aware via Intl/browser tz database, verified independently in Node + Playwright before shipping), day-shift + hour-difference readout, dual 24h business-hours timeline, live auto-updating World Clock (9 cities), Time Zone Abbreviations reference table, PDF export, 6 H2 content sections + 6 FAQs, new OG image |
| 4 | IRA Calculator | Upgrade (thin) | ⬅️ NEXT |
| 5 | Roth IRA Calculator | Upgrade (thin) | pending — sibling of #4, do together if convenient |
| 6 | Annuity Payout Calculator | Upgrade (thin) | pending — sequel to Annuity Calculator, reuse its patterns |
| 7 | P/E Ratio Calculator | **New page** (doesn't exist yet) | pending |
| 8 | Gold Calculator | **New page** (doesn't exist yet) | pending |

When #3–8 are all done, re-pull GSC data and re-rank the next batch — don't
assume this exact order still holds after a few weeks of new data.

## Also completed (ad-hoc audit requests, outside the numbered queue above)

- **Mortgage Calculator**: fixed a misleading "Live" rates badge that was
  showing 15-day-stale hardcoded numbers (now honestly labeled, sourced from
  Freddie Mac PMMS + Bankrate 5/1 ARM, both dated); added visible TOC; added
  a Biweekly Payment Option feature (true 26-period/year amortization,
  verified independently in Node before shipping); reordered the results
  column so Loan Summary / Biweekly sit above the breakdown chart (less
  scrolling to the numbers that matter); added an Extra Payments vs.
  Refinancing vs. Recasting content section + 2 FAQs.
- **Site-wide breadcrumb rollout**: all 193 pages that lacked one.

## Standing notes for next session

- **GSC data** (9-day window ending ~Jul 18, 2026): 11 total clicks, 498
  impressions, avg. position 53.1. Only click-generating query was "leverage
  calculator" (already a custom-built page). Everything else is
  impression-only long-tail on a brand-new domain — ranking improvements are
  realistically a matter of weeks-to-months, not days. Re-check GSC every
  2–4 weeks to see if the priority order above should change.
- **Security**: the GitHub PAT used in past sessions was pasted in plaintext
  in chat multiple times and should be treated as burned — rotate it on
  GitHub and use a fresh token when resuming work, rather than reusing one
  from an old conversation transcript. As of this session (Jul 20, 2026),
  this happened again — treat that token as burned too and rotate before
  the next session. Consider setting up a way to authenticate that doesn't
  require pasting the raw token into chat each time (e.g. the user storing
  it outside the conversation and Claude Code/CLI picking it up from local
  environment instead).
- **Workflow / no repo clutter**: all scratch work (`build_*.py`,
  `test_*.js`, `verify_*.js`, screenshots) lives in the sandbox's
  `/home/claude/work/` scratch directory for that session only — it is
  never part of this repo and never committed. Only the actual page file
  (`<slug>/index.html`), its `og/<slug>.png`, and any shared files touched
  (`sitemap.xml`, `calculators-index.json`, `all-calculators/index.html`)
  get `git add`ed. Nothing accumulates in the repo between sessions.
